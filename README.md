# 🧮 My Simple Calculator

Hi there! 👋  
This is a small calculator I built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
It does all the basic math stuff like add, subtract, multiply, and divide.

---

## ✨ What it does
- ➕ Add numbers  
- ➖ Subtract numbers  
- ✖️ Multiply numbers  
- ➗ Divide numbers  
- 🧹 Clear button to reset everything

## 🎨 Why I made this
I wanted to practice **JavaScript** and see how HTML + CSS + JS work together.  
This project helped me learn about:
- Event handling  
- DOM manipulation  
- Styling with CSS  

---

## 🚀 Try it out
Just open the `index.html` file in your browser and start calculating!  
(You can also host it online using GitHub Pages if you want to share it with friends.)

## 🌱 What's next
- Add a **dark mode** 🌑  
- Support **keyboard input** ⌨️  
- Add **more features** like %, √, and ^

THANK YOU!
